2) #IMP
When you use a plain import statement, such as import printer,
the Python interpreter is instructed to allow you to access printer’s
functions using namespace qualification. However, it is possible to be
more specific. If you use from printer import print_lol, the
specified function (print_lol in this case) is added to the current
namespace, effectively removing the requirement for you to use
namespace qualification. But you need to be careful. If you already have
a function called print_lol defined in your current namespace, the
specific import statement overwrites your function with the imported
one, which might not be the behavior you want.

To create own module:
    0. Begin by creating a folder OMV
    1. create and save your module with proper comments as .py file
    2. copy omv.py module file intot the OMV folder.
    3. create a setup.py in new folder, this file has meta data about distribution.
    eg:
        from distutils.core import setup
        
        setup(
        name = 'omv',
        version = '1.0.0',
        py_modules = ['omv'],
        author = 'myusername',
        author_email = 'myusername@mydomain.com',
        url = 'http://www.mywebsite.com',
        description = 'A simple filter for files',
        )
    4. Go to OMV folder and run below command:
        $ python3 setup.py sdist
        OR on windows
        c:\Python31\python.exe setup.py sdist
        
        A collection of status messages appears on screen, 
        confirming the creation of your distribution.

    5. Install your distribution into your local copy of python
    $ python3 setup.py install
    After setup you will see below in your OMV directory
        MANIFEST
        build->lib->omv.py
        dist->omv-1.0.0.tar.gz
        omv.py
        omv.pyc
        setup.py
     6. 
        To use a module simply import it
        import omv
     7. To call a function:
        omv.printFunction() #namespace qualification
     8. If you use from omv import printFunction, function is added to current
     namespace, effectively removing requirement for you to use namesapce qualification
     9. Register with pypi website:
     http://pypi.python.org/
     request for a pypi id.
     10. Upload your code to pypi
     $ python3 setup.py register
     $ python3 setup.py sdist upload
     11. For a re release open setup.py and 
     $ python3 setup.py sdist upload
